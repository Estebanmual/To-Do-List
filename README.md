> In this project you can save all of your missing tasks, you can save your grocerie list and more! Come and check it out


## Milestones

1 . in this milestone I: 
    - Set an array of some simple to-do tasks (array of objects). Each task object contains three keys:
        - description [string].
        - completed [bool].
        - index: [number].
    - Write a function to iterate over the tasks array and populate an HTML list item element for each task.
    - On page load render the dynamically created list of tasks in the dedicated placeholder. The list appears in order of the index values for each task.
